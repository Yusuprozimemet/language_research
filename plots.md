![Revenue Projections](plots/1_financial_projections.png)

### Description
This plot displays a comprehensive 24-month financial projection showing three key metrics:
- **Revenue (Green bars):** Monthly income from paid subscriptions
- **Costs (Red bars):** Monthly operating expenses
- **Net Income (Colored bars):** Profit/loss position (green if positive, red if negative)

### Key Insights
- **Month 3:** €1,917 revenue, €13,500 costs = -€11,103 net (expected startup burn)
- **Month 6:** €7,191 revenue, €12,000 costs = -€4,809 net (scaling begins)
- **Month 12:** €34,527 revenue, €38,000 costs = -€3,473 net (approach break-even)
- **Month 18:** €67,116 revenue, €52,000 costs = €15,116 net (profitable)
- **Month 24:** €93,963 revenue, €62,000 costs = €31,963 net (strong profitability)

### What It Shows
The plot demonstrates the progression from startup burn phase to profitability, with a clear break-even trajectory around Month 26. This is based on **conservative projections** (8-12% conversion rate, not the optimistic 15-20% from V1).
