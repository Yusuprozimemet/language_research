      "marketing is getting obnoxious. no one needs or cares about the “lore” of the bird. the new energy update is one of the worst updates every produced by duolingo including the learning paths update a while ago. this is just a cash grab it disincentivizes free users from making progress and encourages them to pay. duolingo is no longer on the “mission” to make language learning free. plus the lessons aren’t applicable. random words and sentences do not help to learn a language. go to a different app. there are more effective ones",
      "The app went from 5 star language tool to some cash grab, wannabe premium service that no longer serves the original purpose, but nowadays fully entertains corporate greed. Feels like the average pay-to-win platform that has no principles or the old “pro bono publico” mission. Either go fully paid or remove the new energy system. As a long term user, I am deleting it and wish you luck."

      "De nieuwste update is ronduit slecht. De energie is elke keer precies op halverwege de legendarische oefening. De hartjes werkten veel beter! Je krijgt bij het aanvullen van de energie tijdens de legendarische oefening alleen aangeboden om een abonnement af te sluiten, maar de optie om je diamanten te gebruiken laten ze niet zien. Dat is pech, Legendarische oefening weg. Ook zeggen ze je kan een week gratis “Super DuoLingo” gebruiken, en krijg je twee dagen alvorens het eindigt een melding om kosteloos te annuleren. Deze melding heb ik dus niet gekregen en er werd na 6 dagen al een bedrag van maar liefst 104,99€ afgeschreven (gelijk het jaarbedrag en niet eens de maandelijkse optie). Gelukkig heb ik dit via Apple wel snel terug gehad maar vanuit DuoLingo vond ik dit echt slecht! Tevens de AI service desk is echt om te janken, soms heb je gewoon echt een medewerker nodig. Ik hoop oprecht dat bovenstaande punten verbeterd gaan worden want het is een leuke en goede app om een taal te leren."
