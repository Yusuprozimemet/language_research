    "Hi Duo, if the team sees this, could ya please suggest adding Papiamento and African to the app? I’d love to learn those languages!",
    "I really like the app, because you can learn a language with small learning portions and varariety of reading, writeng and speaking. For me personally i would like less repetition.. or more personalised learning (many mistakes > more repetition , little miststakes> faster to the next level) and more positive caracters",
    "It is good that it challenges to keep learning, but I hate how much it manipulates, sometimes being flawed, like stating you missed a day when it is not true, messing up your score of giving wrong tips. I have a paid version and still it pressures for other additions."

  "accessibility_free": [
    "Since the last updates the app got worse and worse. They keep rearranging everything;  Make it impossible to play for free;  and seem to have ditched some of their best features (like the one where you get dubbel XP in de evening if you’ve also played that morning, and dubbel XP in the morning when you’ve played the evening before).",
    "Very easy to use",
    "I really like this app because it’s designed very good and it’s so easy to learn languages definitely get this"
