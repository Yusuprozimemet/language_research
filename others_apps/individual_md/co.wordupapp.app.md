## 📝 Description

The world’s first AI-based English vocabulary builder app. If you are serious about your English, you will fall in love with WordUp. It is the smartest way to perfect your English, and learn every word that matters while enjoying the process!


Vocabulary Builder: 
Vocab builder feature in WordUp utilizes advanced algorithms to expand vocabulary and improve English skills. It recommends a new word each day based on your current knowledge, allowing you to gradually enhance your language proficiency. By incorporating daily words into your learning routine, WordUp ensures steady and consistent growth in your vocabulary.

Knowledge Map
WordUp helps you build a map of your knowledge by identifying the words you know and the words you don't know. It helps you learn new words by identifying the gaps in your vocabulary and suggesting the most important and useful English words to focus on. By incorporating daily vocabulary and tracking your progress, the Knowledge Map enables you to steadily increase your vocabulary and enhance your understanding of English words.
All 25,000 useful English words are ranked in the order of IMPORTANCE, and USEFULNESS, based on how often they are used in real-world spoken English (extracted from thousands of movies, and TV shows).

To actually learn the words that you discover in your Knowledge Map, WordUp gives you everything you need, and more! From word definitions and pictures to tens of entertaining examples from movies, quotes, news, and more. So you get a good feel of how to use each word in context. 

Multilingual Translations
There are also translations in more than 30 languages including French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, ...

The daily reviews then kick in. Like flashcards, the words will come back with games and challenges until you master them. It's called Spaced Repetition, and it's scientifically proven to help memorise them forever!

WordUp is unlike any vocabulary builder app you've seen before. It is not another dictionary app, although it can be used as an English dictionary too.

Suitable for Various Users:
WordUp's novel approach to language learning and expanding your vocabulary will leave you feeling confident and empowered. Whether you are new to English, are preparing for an English exam (IELTS, TOEFL, etc), or are a native English speaker, you will find WordUp helpful and entertaining. Just give it a try and see for yourself!
