## 📝 Description

Memorang is an AI-powered learning app for busy students in higher education who need an easier way to ace their courses and exams. Although originally designed by MIT engineers and doctors to make medical school easier, it’s now available for everyone to use for any subject! Here’s how it works:

1️⃣  Study for free with community flashcards and practice questions, create your own, or ace your exams with professional Study-Packs authored by test-prep experts.

2️⃣  Create a study schedule by choosing a goal date and how much time you have per day to study. You’ll then get a simple, daily stream of learning tasks to complete. Memorang uses artificial intelligence and spaced repetition to calculate what you need to review next and what you’re at risk of forgetting. There’s no better way to save time and stay on track!
