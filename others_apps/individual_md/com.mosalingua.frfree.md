## 💬 Sample Reviews

**Review 1** (★★★★★ - google - 2024-05-02T10:59:23)
> Super app om Frans te leren

**Review 2** (★★ - google - 2021-11-15T22:03:54)
> Ziet er op het eerste gezicht leuk en nuttig uit, maar in de app zitten tientallen kleine maar vaak funeste spelling en grammatica fouten, waardoor je het eigenlijk ook verkeerd leert. Ook slaan sommige vertalingen ronduit nergens op.

**Review 3** (★★★★ - google - 2019-05-16T08:01:00)
> Leuke handige app om een nieuwe taal te leren. De tips of uitspraken van beroemdheden die vrijkomen door te spelen, vind ik onnodig. Een bonus vrijspelen in de zin van meer gratis toegang tot diverse onderdelen zou ik meer waarderen.

**Review 4** (★★★★★ - google - 2019-04-11T16:46:43)
