# TaalBuddy: Complete Business Plan
*Real Dutch Learning: Grammar + Conversation + Community*

**Last Updated:** November 9, 2025  
**Launch Target:** 12 weeks (Month 1-3)

---

## Executive Summary

**The Problem:** Dutch learners plateau at A2 level using existing apps. Duolingo caps progress with energy limits and lacks grammar explanations (27.2% complaint concentration). Babbel offers quality but costs €12.99/month—too expensive for students and young professionals.

**Our Solution:** TaalBuddy delivers unlimited AI conversation practice, contextual grammar tooltips, and practical vocabulary at €5.99/month—half the price of competitors with superior features.

**Market Opportunity:** 
- €8-12M five-year value
- Duolingo has -14 net sentiment (only negative app in 7-app comparison)
- 12.8% explicit churn intent = 3.8M dissatisfied users annually
- 60-point grammar gap + 65-point conversation gap = validated unmet needs

**Validated Demand:** 2,146 reviews analyzed + 20 qualitative interviews confirm 85% want grammar, 80% want conversation, 70% want topic vocabulary.

**Financial Targets:**
- Month 3: 1,000 users, 150 paid (15% CVR), €897 MRR
- Month 12: 12,000 users, 2,400 paid (20% CVR), €14,376 MRR
- Break-even: Month 19-20 (€35K MRR)
