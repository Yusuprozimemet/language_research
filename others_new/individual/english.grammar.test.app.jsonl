    "description": "Language learning requires a lot of books and different online resources to be used during the curriculum. This is a time-consuming and uncomfortable way to learn English.  \r\nOur language app is another way to study English and to practice English. Stunning minimalist design and clear user interface make it easy to test your grammar skills.\r\nThis English Grammar Test app is perfect for Intermediate and Upper-Intermediate levels.\r\nThe test is divided into two levels. Each one contains 30 tests with 20 exercises. \r\nWe have managed to put 20 English grammar units (for each level) in each test in a way that each question is a part of a certain unit. \r\nWhen you complete your English test you see which aspects of English grammar you are good at and which of them require more practice.\r\nWhen you make a mistake the app explains you why your answer was not correct. Here we offer you an absolutely unique feature — simple explanations for each question that help you understand why we should use certain answer instead of the other.\r\nEnglish learning is nothing without feedback. Use our app to get information about your good and bad sides. Take a grammar test once or twice a week during your curriculum and analyze your results. Focus not on mistakes but on the explanations given. \r\nWith the progress page provided in the app you can see your total score and result of each english test. There are three scales from bad to perfect which indicate your percentage. If your total score is colored green then you are ready for a new level.\r\nAnother unique feature that you will not find in other apps is the English chat. Download the app and join the chat where you can speak English with thousands of learners around the world. \r\nMoreover, our app provides FREE daily classes, exercises and lessons via popular social media channels.\r\nLearn English free, find new friends — this is the best English practice you can find at the store!\r\nDownload one app to get much more: practice, analysis, communication, interesting information.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- 60 tests and 1200 english exercises\r\n- 20 English grammar units in every test\r\n- simple explanations\r\n- total score and progress analytics\r\n- English chat\r\n- clear user interface\r\n- beautiful design\r\n- daily English lessons and exercises\r\n\r\nSyllabus covered in english test:\r\n\r\n- Word Order\r\n- Articles\r\n- Present Tenses\r\n- Past Tenses\r\n- Future Tense\r\n- Passive Voice\r\n- Modal Verbs\r\n- Phrasal Verbs\r\n- Irregular Verbs\r\n- Pronouns\r\n- Adjectives\r\n- Adverbs\r\n- Relative Clauses\r\n- Noun plus Preposition\r\n- Prepositions\r\n- Adjective plus Preposition\r\n- Nouns\r\n- Some, any, a lot of, many, much etc.\r\n- Conditionals\r\n- Reported Speech\r\n- Gerund\r\n- Infinitives\r\n- Confusing Words\r\n- Linking Words\r\n- Expressing hypothetical meaning\r\n- Word Formation",

It even has a more difficult version of the normal app. Both of these versions have lots of tests with each 30 questions, and of course is each answer explained well. But on the downside, it is fairly easy.",
