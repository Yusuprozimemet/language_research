Who makes the flashcards?

===

The entire GRE wordlist is selected and defined with usage examples by Magoosh’s expert GRE tutor, Chris Lele. He has been teaching the GRE for more than 10 years, runs a popular vocabulary series on YouTube and he’s also written an eBook on vocabulary. He is nigh unbeatable in Scrabble, or any other word game for that matter.


How well will I learn the words?

===

Academic research has found that memories are formed by repeated exposure to new information, so Magoosh’s flashcard app uses a spaced repetition system. Words you are learning will reappear frequently (occurring less frequently the better you know them) and words you already know won’t be repeated. The GRE word list is culled so that you focus on only the most important words.


Your practice will focus on the words that you need to review the most to make sure the words you learn will really stick.
