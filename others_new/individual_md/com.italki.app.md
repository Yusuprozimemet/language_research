## 💬 Sample Reviews

**Review 1** (★★★★★ - google - 2025-07-30T19:52:21)
> A great way to find teachers. It's so convenient that lessons are purchased through the platform (no payment hassles!). I've had over 150 lessons in two languages and am extremely pleased. I recommend italki to my own students.

**Review 2** (★★ - google - 2022-08-20T22:14:23)
> Disappointing. Not the quality and service as their competitors. It is focussed on instant lessons and short term goals. You won't find quality teachers who will schedule a real course with you like on Preply. Everything is focussed on one more lesson, without a plan.

**Review 3** (★★★★★ - google - 2020-12-26T03:14:48)
> Best app ever

**Review 4** (★ - google - 2018-09-06T08:47:13)
> Loading conversations takes ages, I always need to use my pc instead. Sometimes need to log in again as well. Not practical

**Review 5** (★ - google - 2016-04-29T21:07:53)
> Kom er niet in
