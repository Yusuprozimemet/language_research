## 📝 Description

What if 🇳🇱 Dutch vocabulary learning would be a crazy fun game instead of boring memorisation drills? Drops makes language learning an effortless fun. Practical vocabulary is bound to your memories through beautiful graphics and quick mini-games.
The crazy part? You have only 5 mins per day. Might sound insane but works like charm! :)
These are the ingredients of the secret sauce:
👀 100% illustrated: Pictures directly carry the meaning -  you don’t have to use your native language at all! No intermediary. Faster, more effective and of course more fun! :)
🏎 5 min sessions: limiting practice time sounds crazy but it it makes it incredibly addictive - which is cool thing for learning. The barrier of entry is close to zero so you can’t have any excuses: you’ll have 5 minutes even on the busiest day!
🕹 Effortless play: We know why games are fun and addictive and distilled the essence into Drops. The result is a truly immersive experience but it’s not waste of your time while you play because you build a valuable knowledge.
⚡Qucik: Keyboard typing is painfully slow. Welcome rapid swipes and taps! Trust us, you’ll need those extra seconds during the quick learning session ;)
🎯 Vocabulary only: Zero grammar, just handpicked practical words. That’s our focus and we do it extremely well. The app teaches the Korean “alphabet” Hangul (hangoul) too!
💁Forge a habit: Drops wants to make you language learning addict. Effectiveness is nothing without a well established habit. We help you build one!
We are extremely proud of our lovely word pronunciations by seasoned voice talents!
Drops is free for casual learners: more than 1700 words in 99 topics are all available for everyone. Hardcore language learners can subscribe for premium to progress faster with unlimited learning time. Subscriptions start from $2.99 / month.

Die 5 Gratisminuten reichen, wenn man es nicht eilig hat, auf jeden Fall aus. 5 Minuten sind für meinen Alltag perfekt, bei weniger wäre der Lerneffekt wohl nicht so gut und bei mehr findet man vielleicht keine Zeit mehr im Alltag. Die Werbung ist auch nicht aufdringlich. Auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen. Der Amsterdam Urlaub kann kommen! 😊",
