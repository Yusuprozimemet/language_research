## 💬 Sample Reviews

**Review 1** (★★★★★ - google - 2025-02-16T23:25:38)
> I've tried many similar apps but this app does it in terms of simplicity and effectiveness.

**Review 2** (★★★★★ - google - 2024-10-15T14:18:14)
> The only thing that this app still needs for me to give it 5 stars is the ability to make your own flashcards without the app having to recognize it as a word. I can't make complete collections of words I encounter in books or TV shows because the app will not recognize some of them as Spanish words...
