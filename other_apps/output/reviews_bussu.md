To understand customer feedback, I've analyzed the provided 250 reviews from Google Play (spanning 2020 to 2025). Reviews were categorized based on recurring themes. Many are in Dutch, English, or mixed languages, but I've translated key excerpts where needed for clarity. Overall sentiment: 
- **Positive**: ~52% (praise for depth, native-speaker interaction, and real-life focus).
- **Negative**: ~35% (dominated by technical bugs, paywall frustration, and language gaps).
- **Neutral/Mixed**: ~13% (balanced views or feature suggestions).

Categories are based on frequency and impact. I've included counts (out of total reviews), examples, and quotes. Note: Some reviews fit multiple categories, but I assigned them to the primary theme.

| Category | Count | Description & Key Insights | Example Reviews |
|----------|-------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Learning Experience & Effectiveness** | 68 | Strong praise for grammar explanations, real-life conversations, repetition, and cultural insights. Often compared favorably to Duolingo for depth and practical use. Some note uneven difficulty or lack of challenge at higher levels. | - "the grammatica learning in this app is the best I have seen so far." (3-star, 2025)<br>- "je leert veel meer dan bij duolingo en de kwaliteit is ook veel beter" (5-star, 2025, Dutch: "you learn much more than with Duolingo and the quality is much better")<br>- "Not only just grammar and voc but culture too!!!!!!" (5-star, 2025)<br>- "De moeilijkheidsgraad van de lessen klopt niet... blijft vragen die onmogelijke opgave" (2-star, 2025, Dutch: "The difficulty level is off... keeps asking impossible tasks") |
| **Community & Native-Speaker Feedback** | 29 | Highlighted as a unique strength: writing/speaking exercises corrected by natives. Motivates users and builds confidence. A few find correction prompts annoying or opt-out missing. | - "oefeningen die worden gecorrigeerd door madrelingua. Fantastico." (4-star, 2025)<br>- "feedback van mensen waar de taal die je studeert hun moedertaal van is." (5-star, 2025, Dutch: "feedback from people for whom the language is their native tongue")<br>- "Great app... I especially love the peer review system." (5-star, 2023)<br>- "constantly begging you to correct other people’s exercises is extremely annoying" (3-star, 2024) |
| **Usability & Interface** | 41 | Appreciated for short, structured lessons and ease of use. Dutch users frequently complain about no Dutch interface (forces English). Sync between app/web is inconsistent; some want widgets or family plans. | - "Makkelijk en leuk om op deze manier te leren." (5-star, 2022, Dutch: "Easy and fun to learn this way")<br>- "ik krijg de interfacetaal niet in het nederlands. hier heb ik niks aan" (1-star, 2025, Dutch: "can't get the interface in Dutch. useless to me")<br>- "mobile app and the web version don't sync with each other." (4-star, 2024)<br>- "I'd love to be able to have a widget of this app" (5-star, 2025) |
| **Technical Issues & Bugs** | 38 | Frequent login failures (Google/Facebook), slow loading, speech recognition glitches, ad freezes, and offline mode bugs. Arabic input blocked in exams; Japanese character errors. | - "can't login with my google account anymore?" (1-star, 2025)<br>- "Spreekoefeningen werken niet tijdens de lessen, moet ze telkens overslaan" (3-star, 2025, Dutch: "Speech exercises don't work, have to skip them")<br>- "loopt bij mij standaard vast bij de externe reclame" (3-star, 2024, Dutch: "freezes on external ads")<br>- "Exam question 'write Arabic' and then prevent the user from answering" (1-star, 2024) |
| **Pricing & Subscription Issues** | 44 | Free tier feels restrictive (locks grammar, quizzes, levels). Premium seen as expensive but "worth it" by some. Complaints about ads, forced upgrades, auto-renewals, and refund issues. | - "na 2 lessen moet je al geld betalen om verder te kunnen" (1-star, 2022, Dutch: "after 2 lessons you have to pay to continue")<br>- "Expensive, but honestly worth it compared to others." (5-star, 2025)<br>- "too many ads. And it is even stuck on loading sometimes" (3-star, 2024)<br>- "I cancelled my subscription last year... Now I found out I was billed AGAIN?" (1-star, 2022) |
| **Language Availability & Support** | 22 | Missing courses (Korean, Swedish, Dutch, Finnish, Hungarian, Bulgarian). Dialect issues (Canadian vs. European French, wrong Arabic). Levels stop at B2 for many languages. | - "Zweeds is er niet bij... dus voor mij geen goede app" (1-star, 2024, Dutch: "Swedish not available... not good for me")<br>- "the French used in the app is Canadian french... not useful in France." (3-star, 2025)<br>- "only offers levels A1 - B2 Russian." (2-star, 2025)<br>- "I wanted to learn arab but i didnt get the rights arabic" (3-star, 2024) |
| **Comparisons to Other Apps** | 18 | Overwhelmingly preferred over Duolingo for grammar, explanations, and seriousness. A few miss Duolingo’s free access or gamification. | - "veel meer diepgang dan Duolingo: met de uitleg van de grammatica" (5-star, 2025, Dutch: "much more depth than Duolingo with grammar explanations")<br>- "Much better than Duolingo! This is harder but I'm learning more" (5-star, 2023)<br>- "beter dan Duolingo, omdat je uitleg krijgt" (5-star, 2024, Dutch: "better than Duolingo because you get explanations")<br>- "Duolingo is much better." (3-star, 2023, re: slowness & paywall) |
| **Feature Requests & Suggestions** | 18 | More reminders (notifications unreliable), family accounts, Dutch UI/course, widgets, offline reliability, and ability to skip/test out of known content. | - "wish the app actually sent lesson reminders" (3-star, 2025)<br>- "bestaat er ook zoiets als een 'familie-account'?" (4-star, 2025, Dutch: "is there a family account?")<br>- "Prima app nu nog Nederlands toevoegen als interface taal." (4-star, 2023, Dutch: "Great app, now add Dutch as interface language")<br>- "you still need to do the lesson [after passing test] so that the percentage goes up." (2-star, 2024) |
