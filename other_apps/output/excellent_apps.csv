<b>HOW DID WE DEVELOP SUCH A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT TOOL FOR LEARNING ENGLISH FROM SCRATCH?</b>

<b>1.</b> We've developed an accessible and effective <b><u>GRAMMAR COURSE</u></b> for all-level learners.  English grammar can be confusing and overwhelming. Good news: we've done all the hard work for you. We took the most essential and relevant grammar and broke it down into bite-sized topics complete with drills. Each topic is a simple rule or structure, which comes with an instant comprehension check. With this system you can learn English grammar from the basics, all by yourself.

<b>2.</b>We've created an improved <b><u>FLASHCARD LIBRARY</u></b> for more effective word learning. Each flashcard has a sentence which helps memorize the word using associations. The app uses <b>spaced repetition</b> to help you remember every word. Expand your vocabulary fast with Simpler. 

<b>3.</b> At Simpler we know the importance of <b>listening skills</b> and learning the correct pronunciation from the very beginning. That's why every phrase in our exercises is voiced by a native speaker. And in our <b><u>PRACTICE</u></b> section you can put new grammar and vocabulary to use and role play one of the two speakers in a real-life dialogue.  

<b>4.</b> <u><b>DRILLS</b></u> are one of the key elements of our course. These are grammar exercises, such as completing a sentence or typing in the translation of a phrase. The drills train you to formulate correct sentences and use new grammar without even thinking about it. Some of the previously learned grammar is regularly added to your drills to keep your memory strong. We use various types of exercises in our drills to maximize the efficiency and make them fun. 

<b>5.</b> <b>Practice makes perfect.</b> You can select <u><b>RAPID PACE</b></u> and set your DAILY GOAL for extra motivation. Practice regularly and see the effects within a week!  

<b>7.</b> <u><b>A UNIQUE FEATURE</b></u>: Enjoy thrilling detective stories adapted for English learners! Learn new words and phrases and start thinking in English as you solve crimes and mysteries.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn English phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

The secret is to make it simple. Have you ever heard a song in the radio which had you bopping your head and wanting to sing along?

Mondly’s state-of-the-art speech recognition shows you how well you already speak and where you can improve. It’s fun and doesn’t even feel like learning. Especially because Mondly uses your mother language so you never get lost in translation.

<b>The second step is even easier</b>. Take a break. Your lesson is never more than 9 minutes long and here is why: Your brain needs a rest to store the new information. And while you’re busy with your life, Spanish words and sentences get anchored in your long-term memory.

<b>The result:</b> You find yourself effortlessly knowing what to say and when. Don’t worry about the exact timing. Mondly gives you control over the entire process. You receive friendly reminders exactly when your brain is set for the next dose of knowledge.

<b>The third step is all about you.</b> Because now you’re ready to create your own phrases and adding your individual touch and personality back into the conversation. And when you want to practice, Mondly’s interactive chat-bot becomes your pocket tutor. 

There are over 40 practical, real-life situations which take you to the restaurant, shopping, exploring the city and many more.
But that’s not the only reason why Mondly gives you the confidence to speak Spanish. Because the HandsFree mode lets you practice without looking at the screen. Just connect your headphones and you’re in Paris, chatting away with the locals.

<b>Need a quick boost of motivation?</b> Check your progress with the advanced statistics and intelligent reporting. It shows you how far you have come in your journey to master the 5,000 words and phrases Mondly offers you.
