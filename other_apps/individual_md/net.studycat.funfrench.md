## 📝 Description

From the award-winning creators of Studycat for Schools, comes Learn French! The #1 way for kids to learn français!

From preschool and beyond, Learn French by Studycat inspires children's innate love of learning with interactive games and activities.

Our bite-sized lessons will keep your child motivated while they discover a new language and build bilingual skills for a lifetime!

WHY STUDYCAT?

• Learn French, in French. All our activities focus on virtual language immersion, which means your child won't be hearing any English, only French! This might be confusing at first, but trust us, it's the best way to learn.

• Everyday Language. Our lessons teach words and expressions that kids can apply in their everyday lives, so they can get a head start developing their bilingual abilities.

• Get Talking Fast. With our interactive speaking challenges, kids will be encouraged to speak entire words and phrases on their own! The earlier kids start their language-learning journey, the more likely they are to reach proficiency quickly.

• Vocal Variety. Our characters' voices use different tones, expressions, and accents so that kids can pick up on the subtleties of pronunciation from different speakers.

• Designed by Experts. All our activities are designed by language and early-education experts. Thoughtfully developed lessons will build your child's confidence with every step.

• Learner Profiles (coming soon). Create up to four personalized profiles for different family members, allowing tailored learning paths and individual progress tracking.

• Safe for Kids & Ad-Free. Parents can rest easy knowing that there are no pesky ads to distract children from their learning. All content is appropriate for ages 3 and up.

• Offline Learning. On a plane, at a restaurant, or in a park? No problem! Learn French by Studycat is available for both online and offline use.
