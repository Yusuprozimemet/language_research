**Review 1** (★★★ - google - 2025-10-01T21:18:04)
> perfect app! i really like the facts which helps me remember it better. the ai calls dont work whenever i say something I cant continue. i would like to do more with pronunciation in depth

**Review 2** (★★ - google - 2025-06-23T19:13:43)
> the way it makes you learn languages is overall beter then duolingo i feel like, however you can only do like 5 lessons a day without getting the subscription.

**Review 3** (★★★★★ - google - 2025-05-07T22:03:28)
> i just started this learning app, i already find it better then Doulingo, the explainations is a big plus. there is only 1 down side for me and others that have an basic knowledge off Spanish or more, there is no test in the beginning to see how far you are so you can start more at your own level! u...

**Review 4** (★★★★★ - google - 2025-03-02T14:26:32)
> i love the app

**Review 5** (★★★★★ - google - 2024-10-21T13:12:48)
> This is a clear app. It explains everything you learn with tips to remember it. Only from English to French or Spanish, but more will follow. The AI voice is female with a French accent. Lessons are logical and quick. Well worth the Pro version. Customer support is very good. The widget is cute!
