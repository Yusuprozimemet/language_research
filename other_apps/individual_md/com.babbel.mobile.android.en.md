      "review": "I've had a great experience with Babbel over the past 6 months & about 40 hours total so far doing 10-15 mins per day learning Dutch! I'm still pretty much a \"beginner\" or A1 but something about the more realistic approach that Babbel uses keeps me coming back each day for a lesson & some vocabulary review! I tried Duolingo in the past but couldn't get into it despite the classic aggressive reminders. I don't need to know how to say \"The boy has bread\" lol...",
