It shows you how much the average time it takes for each level. The second thing I want to talk about is the Home screen. You can see your Daily Workout in there and how much time there's left for 'training'. The bad things about this app is that the explanation is sometimes very hard to understand.

Ik heb vaak problemen met concentratie waardoor leren soms frustrerend is. Met deze app vind ik het leuk en makkelijk. Enig minpuntje voor mij is 1 van de spelletjes mogelijkheden. Het Echo spelletje; de elektronische stem spreekt daar de worden soms bijna onverstaanbaar uit. Zelfs met koptelefoon kon ik het niet altijd goed uitmaken. Met name bij korte woordjes zoals 'trite'. Maar dat vind ik niet storend genoeg om er geen 5 sterren voor te geven: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",
